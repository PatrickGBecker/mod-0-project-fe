## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

* It felt more exciting! Relying on muscle memory and deliberately thinking through problems step-by-step on my own has boosted my confidence moving forward.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* Reddit probably utilizes arrays to update its main page with the most up-voted content. The constantly growing user input adds new elements into the arrays for up-voted/down-voted content which would probably trigger a loop to move it up or down the main page.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* Array methods can perform specific actions to items/elements within an array (Finding, sorting, replacing, removing, filtering, etc.) These methods can help the interpreter execute statements with arrays more quickly than if the elements and instructions were written out item by item.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* Loops are very helpful when the user input is a question or command. With command inputs, arrays can be utilized to generate lists and specific information contained within the array. When the user must answer a question, loops can check what conditions are true and run the appropriate code for that input/condition. Arrays can be helpful if the loop must search through vast amounts of data, but unnecessary if the loop is being utilized for a simple task, like counting or yes or no questions.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* A loop is like a book. When you see pictures or writing on a page, you pause and look at what's there. If a page is blank, you just turn the page without look at it. The book is the initializer. The pictures/writing are the conditions that are true. The blank pages are the conditions that are false. Once we run the true content, we flip the page until we find more true content or the book ends.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* When are 'while' loops more appropriate than 'for' loops? How does writing the initial expression/condition/incrementor-decrementor change?
* Should arrays always be defined outside of a loop?
* Should if & else-if statement always be within the loop?
* When is the Array Literal more appropriate than the Array Constructor?
