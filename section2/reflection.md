## Section 2 Reflection

1. **What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?**

* SMART Goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Time-Based) are important so that you can keep yourself on track for what lies ahead in your learning journey.
* The concept of striving to improve within one’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) by facing coding challenges that ask you to learn and push a little beyond what you’ve already mastered.

2. **In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?**

I already focus on effort, deliberate practice, persisting through mistakes & failure and learning from other peoples mistakes; but I am not very good at setting clear goals and reflecting often.

3. **In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?**

I did not really notice the lack of guard rails because the homework assignments and review have helped me remember the process without aid.

4. **What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.**

A conditional statement is the varying result of an evaluation of varying values that change the path of our code. A daily life example is whether or not you slept well the night before. If you slept well, you will wake up feeling refreshed. If you did not sleep well, you will awaken feeling lethargic. Web applications use conditional statements every time you enter a password. If it's wrong, you will be notified and eventually locked out of the app.

5. **How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.**

Multiple conditions are added with else-if statements and switch statements. The program reads them like an upside down family tree. There are parents (conditions) and each have their own children (Statements). Although, there is more cross-over in the parents 'code' than is recommended in a real family tree.

6. **What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?**

Conditional operators and Logical operators help you determine if your conditional statements are met. Practicing code in a text editor like Atom or VS Code or utilizing branches of gits will help you de-bug any issues by yourself or through collaboration.

7. **What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?**

I believe my questions can be answered with more practice. I am still wrestling with the utilization of the Logical AND Operator and Logical OR Operator. Using Comparative operators makes more sense to me right now.
